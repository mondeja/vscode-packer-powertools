  "description": "You can optionally create a single specialized provisioner called an `error-cleanup-provisioner`. This provisioner will not run unless the normal provisioning run fails. If the normal provisioning run does fail, this special error provisioner will run _before the instance is shut down_. This allows you to make last minute changes and clean up behaviors that Packer may not be able to clean up on its own.",
