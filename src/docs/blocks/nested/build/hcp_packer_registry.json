  "description": "The `hcp_packer_registry` block lets you customize the metadata Packer sends to HCP Packer Registry. It configures the details of an image that is created or updated within the HCP Packer registry. This block is available from version 1.7.7 of Packer.\n\nThe presence of a `hcp_packer_registry` block in a build block will enable HCP Packer mode. Packer will push all builds within that build block to the remote registry if the appropriate HCP credentials are set (`HCP_CLIENT_ID` and `HCP_CLIENT_SECRET`). If no HCP credentials are set, Packer will fail the build and exit immediately to avoid any potential artifact drift between the defined builders (source blocks) and the HCP Packer registry.",
