    "description": "Communicators are the mechanism Packer uses to upload files, execute scripts, etc. with the machine being created.\n\nCommunicators are configured within the builder section. Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n\n- `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most provisioners also can't be used.\n- ssh - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This is usually the default.\n- winrm - A WinRM connection will be established.\n\nIn addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy files.",
