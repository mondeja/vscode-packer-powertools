    "description": "Communicators are the mechanism Packer uses to upload files, execute scripts, etc. with the machine being created. They are configured within the builder section. Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n\n- `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most provisioners also can't be used.\n- `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This is usually the default.\n- `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.",
