  "description": "The `ansible-local` Packer provisioner will execute `ansible` in Ansible's \"local\" mode on the remote/guest VM using Playbook and Role files that exist on the guest VM. This means Ansible must be installed on the remote/guest VM. Playbooks and Roles can be uploaded from your build machine (the one running Packer) to the vm. Ansible is then run on the guest machine in [local mode](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_delegation.html#local-playbooks) via the `ansible-playbook` command.\n\n-> **Note:** Ansible will _not_ be installed automatically by this provisioner. This provisioner expects that Ansible is already installed on the guest/remote machine. It is common practice to use the [shell provisioner](/docs/provisioners/shell) before the Ansible provisioner to do this.",
