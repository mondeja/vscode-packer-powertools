  "description": "The `ansible` Packer provisioner runs Ansible playbooks. It dynamically creates an Ansible inventory file configured to use SSH, runs an SSH server, executes `ansible-playbook`, and marshals Ansible plays through the SSH server to the machine being provisioned by Packer.\n\n-> **Note:** Any `remote_user` defined in tasks will be ignored. Packer will always connect with the user given in the json config for this provisioner.",
