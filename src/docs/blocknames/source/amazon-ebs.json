  "description": "The `amazon-ebs` Packer builder is able to create Amazon AMIs backed by EBS volumes for use in [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). For more information on the difference between EBS-backed instances and instance-store backed instances, see the [\"storage for the root device\" section in the EC2 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device).\n\nThis builder builds an AMI by launching an EC2 instance from a source AMI, provisioning that running machine, and then creating an AMI from that machine. This is all done in your own AWS account. The builder will create temporary keypairs, security group rules, etc. that provide it temporary access to the instance while the image is being created. This simplifies configuration quite a bit.\n\nThe builder does _not_ manage AMIs. Once it creates an AMI and stores it in your account, it is up to you to use, delete, etc. the AMI.\n\n-> **Note:** Temporary resources are, by default, all created with the prefix `packer`. This can be useful if you want to restrict the security groups and key pairs Packer is able to operate on.",
